## Overview

**Project Title**: Refugee Digital Empowerment Network (R-DEN)  
**Project Lead**: Teodor Yankov  
**Duration**: October 2022 - September 2023  
**Team Members**: Shashwat, Anna-Noemie, Faissal, James, Luis, Monir, Reece

R-DEN focuses on addressing the digital access gaps experienced by refugees and asylum seekers in London. The project aims to close the digital divide by developing practical skills and offering accessible resources that foster digital empowerment within vulnerable populations.

## Objectives

The digital divide disproportionately impacts refugees due to:

1. **Digital Skills Gaps**: Many lack basic digital literacy and English proficiency.
2. **Resource Constraints**: Internet services are often unaffordable, exacerbated by the limitations in refugeesâ€™ financial means.
3. **Policy Barriers**: Asylum seekers in the UK face restrictive policies, such as a limited daily budget and an inability to work.

By improving digital skills and access to the Internet, the project aims to mitigate isolation and provide new opportunities for education, employment, and social integration.

## Strategies and Approach

R-DEN sought to create a collaborative solution by leveraging existing networks of organizations supporting refugees. After consultations with the Good Things Foundation, we identified a gap in digital upskilling and developed the **Refugee Digital Empowerment Handbook**. The handbook compiles easy-to-understand information and resources on key digital skills, serving both as a self-help tool and a resource for training workshops.

### Key Strategies:

- **Collaborative Focus**: Partner with existing London-based NGOs to deliver resources and training.
- **Resource Creation**: Develop a digital handbook addressing key digital literacy topics.
- **Volunteer Support**: Build a database of young professionals and students willing to volunteer in workshops and mentorships.

## Implementation

The project involved three core phases:

1. **Planning**: We identified the critical ways in which refugees need to use ICTs, then outlined these needs in 10 curriculum-style topics.
2. **Research**: Each topic was expanded with research into the basic skills required, existing resources, and testimonials.
3. **Creation**: The content was organized into a visually intuitive slide deck, incorporating flowcharts and interactive text.

## Resources Used

We leveraged tools such as Notion for team organization, Google Docs for planning, Google Slides for the handbook, and Typeform for conducting digital gap diagnostics. Google Forms was also used to recruit young volunteers.

## Impact and Outcomes

Although dissemination is still in progress, the planning and research stages have been successfully completed. The project has the potential to significantly improve the lives of refugees and asylum seekers in London by equipping them with the digital skills necessary to navigate modern life.

### Beneficiaries:

- **Refugees and Asylum Seekers**: Especially those struggling with digital skills, such as the elderly and vulnerable groups.
- **NGOs and Charities**: Organizations can use the resource to enhance their ongoing efforts in digital upskilling.

### Success Stories

In early testing, the draft content helped a Congolese asylum seeker reduce communication costs by teaching her how to use email and WhatsApp effectively. It also connected her to mental health resources and entertainment platforms like YouTube.

## Conclusion

R-DEN represents an important first step in addressing the digital inequalities faced by refugees. Through collaborative efforts and a commitment to supporting existing organizations, this project aims to empower refugees with the skills they need to fully participate in the digital age.

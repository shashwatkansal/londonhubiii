## Overview

**Project Title**: Pathfinder  
**Project Leads**: Flynn Devine and Elissa Makris  
**Duration**: March 2023 - August 2023  
**Team Members**: Abimbola Oladipo, Dua Dahar, Andreas Lo, Mridu Gupta, Samira Gomes, Sarah Alkhedheiri, Salomey Osafo-Ampadu

The **Pathfinder** project aims to guide young aspiring change-makers between 16-24 years old through the challenges of finding a personal and career direction. The mission is to help them understand their values, identify goals, and map a path to achieving their vision through our structured **‘DEEP’** self-paced learning journey.

## Objectives

In today's volatile and fast-paced world, young people are faced with the difficult task of navigating their aspirations amidst an overload of information and societal pressure. Pathfinder provides a clear and structured approach to career and personal development, offering tools for self-exploration and goal-setting.

**Key Objectives**:
- Support young people in exploring their desires and values.
- Provide a framework for identifying personal and career goals.
- Empower young people with tools like systems thinking and self-coaching.
- Help them map a clear path toward their aspirations.

## Strategies and Approach

We designed Pathfinder as a **self-paced learning journey**, combining multiple frameworks and exercises that guide participants in defining their goals. This includes:

- **Discover**: Explore personal values and aspirations.
- **Empower**: Gain skills in systems thinking and self-coaching.
- **Explore**: Identify opportunities and career paths.
- **Plan**: Develop actionable steps towards achieving their goals.

Our first iteration of the Pathfinder journey was beta-tested with a group of young people aged 16-24.

## Implementation

The project was executed through three key phases:

1. **Toolkit Research**: We conducted research into existing toolkits focused on social impact learning and selected a learning platform for content dissemination.
2. **Build and Testing**: The content, including a blueprint and detailed design, was created and tested with feedback from team members and stakeholders.
3. **Toolkit Dissemination**: We identified partners and produced a dissemination plan, aiming to share the toolkit widely on social media and other channels.

## Resources Used

We used **Notion** to build and disseminate the learning content, incorporating resources on **Ikigai**, the **GROW coaching model**, **Maslow’s hierarchy of needs**, and **systems thinking**. We collaborated with organizations like the **Systems Thinking Network** and **Bright Network** for content development.

## Impact and Outcomes

The Pathfinder toolkit has been successfully developed and is now hosted on our **Notion** platform. Although the toolkit has not yet been fully disseminated, the next step will involve gathering user feedback to improve the learning journey and release a second iteration for wider use.

### Beneficiaries:
- **Young People (16-24)**: Especially those facing challenges in making career choices and wanting to create a positive impact in the world.
- **NGOs and Charities**: Organizations working with youth can use the toolkit to help guide their educational initiatives.

### Success Stories:

We partnered with the **Systems Thinking Network** and **Bright Network** to create accessible learning content. Discussions were also held with **Path Finder** (an online learning platform), which expressed interest in hosting the toolkit. Although we decided to develop our own platform, future collaboration remains a possibility.

At this time, we do not have user case examples, but the toolkit is ready for deployment and we expect future success stories as it is disseminated.

## Conclusion

Pathfinder is an essential resource for young people seeking to navigate a complex world and find their place within it. By equipping them with the tools for self-exploration and goal-setting, we aim to empower the next generation of change-makers to take control of their future.

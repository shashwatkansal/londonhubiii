## Project Overview

**Project Title**: AI Perspectives: Exploring the Role of Generative AI in Youth Career and Education Choices in London  
**Project Co-Leads**: Tejas Gorla and Fabio Richter  
**Project Duration**: 15 Jan 2024 - 1 Jul 2024  
**Team Members**: Flynn Devine, Teodor Yankov, Anna-Noémie Ouattara Boni, Salomey Ampadu, Marta Rodino, Elissa Makris, Duaa Aijaz, Tony Mandungu, Faisal Sharif

## Problem Statement

Generative AI is transforming various aspects of life, including the search for and analysis of information, and media creation (e.g., text). While the use of automated decision-making systems by employers is well-studied—particularly for screening CVs, which can result in biases—the use of AI by **job seekers** remains underexplored. This project seeks to investigate:

- How young people perceive and use generative AI in their job search and career development.
- How AI is currently being utilized in these processes.
- What AI-related knowledge or skills young people are seeking to acquire.

## Objectives

To generate a **10-15 page report** summarizing the key findings and insights from young people aged 16-24 in London regarding their usage of generative AI in employment and further education (FE).

### Key Questions:

- How do young people think about the use of AI in employment or further education?
- How are they currently using AI in their job search?
- What are their learning needs when it comes to AI-related skills?

## Impact Areas

The project aligns with several of the Global Shapers’ impact areas:
- **Build Inclusive Communities**
- **Reskill for the Future**
- **Improve Health & Well-being**
- **Deliver Basic Needs**
- **Protect the Planet**
- **Strengthen Civic Engagement**

## Strategies and Approach

The project is structured over six months, with documentation and deliverables being completed in the first three months and distribution-focused activities during the latter half. Key strategies include:

| Month    | Status      | Strategy                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| January  | Completed   | Engaging key stakeholders and reviewing current uses of AI in job search. |
| February | Completed   | Continuing stakeholder engagement and further AI research.                |
| March    | Completed   | Creating surveys for job seekers and employers regarding AI usage.        |
| April    | Ongoing     | Finalizing surveys and starting dissemination through partners.           |
| May      | Not started | Collecting survey responses from various cohorts.                         |
| June     | Not started | Summarizing survey results and providing tips on using AI in job search.  |

## Resources & Collaborators

- **No funding required**
- Partnerships are crucial to reach a broad audience. Potential collaborators include **Bright Network**, **Job Scan**, and internal networks like Shapers' WhatsApp groups.
- Key roles for the project include a **partnership coordinator**, **survey lead**, and **writing lead**.

## Impact and Outcomes

The project is still in its **execution phase**, but we are working on gathering insights into how young people view and use generative AI in their job search and education journey. A comprehensive report will be created after the completion of the survey analysis.

### Beneficiaries

The key beneficiaries of this project are **young people aged 16-24**, particularly those entering the job market or furthering their education. The insights gathered will help young people use generative AI tools more effectively in their career journeys.

## Website for AI Jobs

As part of our commitment to helping young people find AI-related opportunities, we have created the **London AI Jobs** portal. This website serves as a centralized platform for youth to explore AI job openings, further helping them apply the knowledge and skills they gain from AI-related resources and tools.

### Survey Insights

We conducted a survey among young job seekers to understand their preferences and needs regarding AI in their job search. This data will be used to refine our approach and further tailor our report to the needs of this demographic.

Stay tuned for more updates as we progress into the distribution phase and continue working with partners to bring valuable insights to the next generation of change-makers.

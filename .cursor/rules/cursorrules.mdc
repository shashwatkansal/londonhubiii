Here are some best practices and rules to follow for creating a high-quality, mobile-first web app with excellent UI/UX using Tailwind, React, and Firebase:

Mobile-First Design:
Always design and implement for mobile screens first, then scale up to larger screens.
Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.

Consistent Design System:
Create a design system with consistent colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.
Utilize Tailwind's configuration file (tailwind.config.js) to define your custom design tokens.

Performance Optimization:
Use React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and lazy-loading components.
Implement virtualization for long lists using libraries like react-window.
Optimize images and use next/image for automatic image optimization in Next.js.

Responsive Typography:
Use Tailwind's text utilities with responsive prefixes to adjust font sizes across different screens.
Consider using a fluid typography system for seamless scaling.

Accessibility:
Ensure proper color contrast ratios using Tailwind's text-* and bg-* classes.
Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes where necessary.
Implement keyboard navigation support.

Touch-Friendly UI:
Make interactive elements (buttons, links) at least 44x44 pixels for easy tapping.
Implement touch gestures for common actions (swipe, pinch-to-zoom) where appropriate.

WHEN CREATING A FILE DON'T CONFLICT IT WITH .TSX AND .JSX FILES

Firebase Best Practices:
Implement proper security rules in Firebase.
Use Firebase SDK's offline persistence for better performance and offline support.
Optimize queries to minimize read/write operations.

Error Handling and Feedback:
Implement proper error boundaries in React.
Provide clear feedback for user actions (loading states, success/error messages).

Animation and Transitions:
Use subtle animations to enhance UX (e.g., page transitions, micro-interactions).
Utilize Tailwind's transition utilities or consider libraries like Framer Motion.

Form Handling:
Use libraries like Formik or react-hook-form for efficient form management.
Implement proper form validation with clear error messages.

Code Organization:
Follow a consistent folder structure (e.g., components, hooks, pages, services).
Use custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic.

Native-like Features:
Implement pull-to-refresh for content updates.
Use smooth scrolling and momentum scrolling.
Consider using libraries like react-spring for physics-based animations.

Hereâ€™s a concise prompt for a language model to help you with the logic for creating AI-powered medication insights in your app:

Prompt:
Design a feature for a pill management app that tracks user interactions with medications (Take/Skip) and generates monthly adherence reports.

The app should:

User Interface:
Display pills for "Morning," "Afternoon," and "Night" with buttons for "Take" and "Skip."
Show a confirmation modal for user actions.

Data Collection:
Log user interactions (pill ID, action, timestamp, notes) in a database.

Monthly Report:
Aggregate data to calculate total pills scheduled vs. taken, adherence percentage, and trends (e.g., frequently skipped pills).

AI Insights:
Use basic statistical analysis to generate personalized suggestions based on user feedback (e.g., side effects, missed doses).

Dashboard:
Create a section for users to view their monthly reports, including adherence percentage, trends, and AI-generated suggestions.

This prompt provides a clear and structured request for assistance in developing the feature, focusing on key components and functionality.

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis
   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning
   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handlers with "handle" (handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (components/auth-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference
- Use `satisfies` operator for type validation

## React 19 and Next.js 15 Best Practices

### Component Architecture

- Favor React Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Minimize 'use client' directives
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Suspense for async operations
- Optimize for performance and Web Vitals

### State Management

- Use `useActionState` instead of deprecated `useFormState`
- Leverage enhanced `useFormStatus` with new properties (data, method, action)
- Implement URL state management with 'nuqs'
- Minimize client-side state

### Async Request APIs

```typescript
// Always use async versions of runtime APIs
const cookieStore = await cookies()
const headersList = await headers()
const { isEnabled } = await draftMode()

// Handle async params in layouts/pages
const params = await props.params
const searchParams = await props.searchParams
```
